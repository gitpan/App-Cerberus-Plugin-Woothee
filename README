NAME
    App::Cerberus::Plugin::Woothee - Add user-agent information to
    App::Cerberus

VERSION
    version 0.01

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin uses Woothee to add information about the user agent to
    Cerberus. For instance:

        "ua": {
            "is_robot": 0,
            "vendor": "apple",
            "version": {
                "minor": ".1",
                "full": 5.1,
                "major": "5"
            },
            "browser": "safari",
            "device": "iphone",
            "os": "iOS"
        }

REQUEST PARAMS
    User-Agent information is returned when an User-Agent value is passed
    in:

        curl http://host:port/?ua=Mozilla%2F5.0 (compatible%3B Googlebot%2F2.1%3B %2Bhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Fbot.html)

CONFIGURATION
    This plugin takes no configuration options:

        plugins:
          - Woothee

KNOWN ISSUES
    When invoked after any other User-Agent plugin, this one will overwrite
    the results from the other plugins. It's planned to merge the ua
    properties in a later version but this is yet to be implemented.
